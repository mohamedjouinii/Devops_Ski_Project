## 🔧 What This Project Covers  

### ✅ **1. End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins**  
- Set up a **Jenkins pipeline** that automates the workflow:  
  - **Build:** Compile and package the app with **Maven**.  
  - **Test:** Run unit tests using **JUnit** to catch issues early.  
  - **Code Analysis:** Use **SonarQube** to check for security vulnerabilities and bad code practices.  
  - **Artifact Management:** Store packaged `.jar` files in **Nexus** for easy versioning.  
  - **Deployment:** Launch the app inside a **Docker container** using **Docker Compose**.  
  - **Monitoring:** Set up **Grafana & Prometheus** for real-time system performance tracking.  

### 🏗 **2. Build & Dependency Management**  
- Used **Maven** to handle dependencies efficiently and keep things structured.  
- Automated builds with the **Maven wrapper**, so there's no setup hassle.  

### 🛠 **3. Unit Testing & Logging**  
- Integrated **JUnit** to maintain reliable, bug-free code.  
- Configured **Log4j** for detailed application logging, making it easier to debug issues.  

### 📦 **4. Containerization & Deployment**  
- **Dockerized** the Spring Boot app for seamless deployment across different environments.  
- Used **Docker Compose** to manage multiple services easily.  

### 📊 **5. System Monitoring & Performance Optimization**  
- **Prometheus** collects key system metrics like CPU, memory, and database performance.  
- **Grafana** visualizes these metrics in easy-to-read dashboards.  
- Configured **alerts** in Grafana to detect performance issues in real-time.
